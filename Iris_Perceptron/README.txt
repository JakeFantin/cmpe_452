To run program:

EXE only works on Windows as it was compiled on windows.
Recommended to do so in a monitor/command line so that the results are visible for more than a second.
In the folder PerceptronEXE there is a application called perceptron, thats what you run, it returns recall
and percision of the data from test.txt. It only runs if its in the folder with all its libraries.

TestResults.txt is the print out of all the data points classified.
Perception Tool Pictures.doc is the screenshots from the tool used. 

I don't think _pycache_, build, or Perceptron.spec are important. But I left them just
in case they are important to the exe.
